# 🔒 Privacy Policy – Crapules Express Bot

**Last updated: July 14, 2025**

Crapules Express is committed to respecting the privacy of its users.  
This policy explains how data collected by our Discord bot is processed, stored, and protected.

---

## 1. 📥 Data Collected

The bot collects the following data strictly for operational purposes:

- Discord identifiers (username, user ID)  
- Recruitment form responses submitted via modal dialogs  
- Internal HR-related data (recruitment status, blacklist/whitelist flags, application attempts, interview scheduling)  
- Logs of recruitment activities, blacklist/whitelist changes, user departures, and ticket events  

> 🔒 No personal data outside of Discord is collected or stored.

---

## 2. 🎯 Purpose of Data Use

Collected data is used exclusively to:

- Manage recruitment applications and driver profiles within the VTC  
- Track HR workflows, trial periods, and recruitment pipeline progress  
- Enable automated ticketing, convoy invitations, and notifications  
- Provide role-based access and enforce moderation policies (blacklisting, auto-denial after attempts)  
- Generate logs and audit trails for internal transparency and troubleshooting

---

## 3. 🗄️ Data Storage & Security

- Temporary recruitment data resides in private Discord channels accessible only to authorized HR and management roles.  
- All critical and persistent data is stored **locally** on a **self-hosted VPS** running on a **secured personal machine owned by the Lead Developer (Nerfine)**.  
- No data is transmitted to or stored by third-party services.

---

## 4. 🕓 Data Retention and Deletion

### Recruitment Channels

- Inactive recruitment tickets (no "Start" interaction) are deleted automatically after **24 hours**.  
- No form responses are saved unless the recruitment questionnaire is initiated.

### Stored Data

- Recruitment applications and related data are deleted **after 30 days** if the user does not join or complete the process.  
- Driver profiles are archived automatically if the user leaves the Discord server.  
- Blacklist records are retained until a user requests removal or reconciliation.

> 🧪 Automated privacy-enhancing deletion features are in active development.

---

## 5. 🔐 Access Control

Data access is strictly limited to:

- HR personnel  
- Senior HR staff  
- Management team  
- Lead Developer (**Nerfine**)

No external or unauthorized users have access to this data.

## 6. 🧹 User Data Deletion Requests

Users may request immediate deletion of their personal data by:

- Opening a ticket in the **Management Questions** channel  
- Contacting **@nerfine** directly on Discord  
- Sending an email to **nerfine@crapules-express.com**

---

## 7. 🌐 Message Translation Feature

The bot supports reaction-based message translation for non-embed textual messages:  
React with 🌐 `:globe_with_meridians:`, 🇬🇧 `:flag_gb:`, or 🇺🇸 `:flag_us:` to translate a message via DeepL API.

> ℹ️ Note: Embedded messages cannot be translated automatically.
